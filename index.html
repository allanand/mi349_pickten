            <img class="sissy" src="sis.png" alt="Image of the Student Information System">
            
            <h3>Academic Progress</h3>
            <P>The Academic Progress menu effectively shows where a student</P>
            <p>is at in their academic career. It shows all the requirements</p>
            <p>to graduate and highlights the courses students have and still</p>
            <p>need to complete. The features included makes the overall</p>
            <p>student experince better and is easy to find.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
            <h3>Advisor Tab</h3>
            <P>The advisor tab on the other hand, is very difficult to find</P>
            <p>requiring students to navigate through several different menus</p>
            <p>just to get help from an advisor. I think this tab should</p>
            <p> be moved to the main menu where students can utilize this</p>
            <p>essential tool becuase it already has a lot going for it</p>
            <p>when it can be found.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Registering for Classes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scheduling</li>
                <li>Shopping Cart</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scheduling for classes seems overall very intuitive on sis.</p>
            <p>Classes are easy to find and register for and a schedule</p>    
            <p>is provided to show the courses you have once they are added.</p>
            <p>However, this schedule requires another tab to access and</p>
            <p>does not really allow options to build a different schedule</p>
            <p>without first removing courses. I feel like a schedule builder</p>
            <p>tool may solve a lot of these downsides while maintaining what</p>
            <p>already works very well.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When adding courses to your schedule, they can be added</p>
            <p>to what is known as the shopping cart. The shopping cart</p>
            <p>is a tool used to store classes for later use. While the</p>
            <p>feature does work for it's intended purpose, much like the</p>
            <p>website itself, it leaves a lot to be expected. In the case of the</p>
            <p>shopping cart, the naming does not make a lot of sense and </p>
            <p>comes off like it was taken from another website. I believe that</p>
            <p>the shopping cart and SIS as a whole could use this a step to</p>
            <p>revamp the focus of the site.</p>
