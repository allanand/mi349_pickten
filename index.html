            <h3>Academic Progress</h3>
            <P>The Academic Progress menu effectively shows where you</P>
            <p>are at in your academic career. It shows all the requirements</p>
            <p>to graduate and highlights the courses you have and still</p>
            <p>need to complete.The features included make the overall</p>
            <p>student experince better which should be the goal of a</p>
            <P>student website.</P>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
           
            <h3>Advisor Tab</h3>
            <P>The advisor tab is very difficult to find requiring students</P>
            <p>to navigate through several different menus just to get</p>
            <p>help from an advisor. I think this tab should be moved to</p>
            <p>the main menu where students can utilize this essential</p>
            <p>tool more.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Registering for Classes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Scheduling</li>
                <li>Shopping Cart</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scheduling can sometimes be difficult for classes when</p>
            <p>there are collisions because there is not a functional</p>
            <p>way to see the full academic schedule unless if you </p>
            <p>draw it out on a piece of paper yourself. These</p>
            <p>collisions will require a student to continously add and</p>
            <p>remove courses until they have a schedule that works for</p>
            <p>them and costs the student a lot more time as a result.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When adding courses to your schedule, they can be added</p>
            <p>to what is known as the shopping cart. This menu is the</p>
            <p>antithesis of what being a student website is. The</p>
            <p>shopping cart sounds like something that would be</p>
            <p>found on a clothing website, not a student one. In</p>
            <p>other words, the website need to be designed and</p>
            <p>themed more around students.</p>
